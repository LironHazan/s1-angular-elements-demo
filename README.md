# SentinelOne - Angular Elements demo

Let's create a silly component that we can use anywhere!

- Add a silly-button module, component and service.
- export the module and component
- install @angular/elements 
- npm install @webcomponents/custom-elements --save

Pack with local script:
- run: `build:wc`
- possible to serve by running: `npx http-server` from the "simple-dist" path.

** From this point you can use the component as native custom element anywhere!

Pack with ngx-build-plus:

- ng add ngx-build-plus
follow instructions: https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus
